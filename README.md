Thanks for visiting my github profile. I work mainly on private repositories and I usually only publish stuff when I think it benifits everyone. 
Yes, I work on the happy family website. It's a family owned business after all. also, I don't own the buisness. (well ofc, im only 18) nor do I get paid just doing it cus im intrested in helping them. My contributions to the happy family website is I want it to be more customer oriented. That's about it. Nothing much else to say.
